# Principles

- Be aware of the extent of our ignorance.
- Don't try to do the most clever things, simply avoid to do stupid things.
- Always looks the two sides of a coin. Which is the side of the coin, what
  could go wrong that I did not consider.
- Never attribute to malice what stupidity is enough to explain.
- Why make it complicated when it can be simple ? Keep it simple, stupid.
- We can fail our life but we can't fail our death. This is real for our
  products and our companies
